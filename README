***WARNING***
DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION. IT'S QUITE OLD AND ALMOST CERTAINLY VERY INSECURE. 
(The last update of this branch was Oct 2001)


I've put this up for posterity and also from a request by the WP team to relicense
the code as GPL (instead of GPL 2.0)

Biographical note: I originally whipped this up during a couple summer days after 
graduating from USC mostly as an excercise to learn Cold Fusion 4.0 - I wrote a tag 
filter/balancer I believe after a conversation w/ mathowie. balanceTags was written 
first in PHP and then transcoded  to CF as an (incredibly painful) excercise.

A few months later, Michel asked/let me know he was using it in b2.

I'm amazed any of it remains in production, but I believe descendants of this code
continue to live on both in Metafilter and WordPress.

That's humbling, amazing, and more than a bit terrifying. And of course, that's how the
sausage gets made.
